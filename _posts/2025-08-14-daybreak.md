title: "`juniro` - a color palette for each month of the year. ðŸ“†"

I was looking for a 12 item color palette for another project.
I played around with various generators, and ended up with the following snippet. 

```js
const palette = [ ...Array( 12 ).keys() ].map( i => {
    const rgb = okhsl_to_srgb( ( 360 - ( i * 30 + 120 ) % 360 ) / 360, 0.8, 0.7 );
    return rgb_to_hex( ...rgb );
});
```

It rotates through hue with constant saturation and lightness in [OkHsl](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) color space (shoutout BjÃ¶rn Ottosson).
And thus was born "jÅ«ni no iro", "the twelve colors".
